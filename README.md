### Emergency and Urgent Incidents

Emergency and urgent ambulance incidents attended by QAS are divided into 2 categories:
* Emergency (Code 1) incidents are potentially life threatening events that necessitate the use of ambulance warning devices (lights and sirens).
* Urgent (Code 2) incidents may require an undelayed response but do not necessitate the use of ambulance warning devices (lights and sirens).

### Non-Emergency Medically Authorised Incidents
* Non-emergency incidents (Code 3 and Code 4) are attended by an ambulance or patient transport service unit without the use of ambulance warning devices (lights and sirens).
* A non-emergency patient is seen by a medical practitioner and deemed by the medical practitioner as non-emergency but requiring ambulance transport.
